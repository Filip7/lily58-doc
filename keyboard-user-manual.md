## Introduction

Thank you for buying the Lily58 keyboard and build service from me!  
I really enjoy using and making this keyboard, and I hope you will too!

## Configuration of the keyboard

There are a couple of ways to configure this keyboard. The best ways are using QMK directly and/or VIA software. We will dive deep into each one.  
But there are some other firmwares that I haven't used, so I cannot recommend them based on not enough experience with them.  
**Remember we are dealing with flashing firmware!** So tread carefully and do not fry your chip* :D  
*Chip is easily replaceable in case of breakage.

### Quick Overview

## Be aware of

Some oddities I found using the keyboard:  
Plugging in and out the USB-C cable at an angle could pull the chip from the socket, so it may seem that the keyboard has stopped working. Just gently push the chip back into the socket. Ideally, do this when the keyboard is unplugged; you do not want to short-circuit something :)
